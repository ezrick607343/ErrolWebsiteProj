                    <h2>1.0 About me</h2>
                <p>I am Errol, I joined HM forces when I was 17 years old, after leaving the Army, I decided to stay in Germany
                    and started work as a long distance lorry driver. I was happy that I was working but I knew deep down that
                    was where I didn’t want to end my working life.
                    I decided that I wanted to change my career and started researching computers, once I bought my first PC I
                    attended a basic course in Windows and PC hardware, and from that point, I gained a very strong interest in
                    computers and wanted to learn more about the hardware and software side of things. I also attended a couple
                    of seminars in Linux as I was very interested in what it was about.
                    From this initial interest I applied to attend college as I was successful in my application. I attended a
                    German college for two years full time and studied a course in Information and Telecommunication Systems
                    Engineering. since qualifying I've worked as a casino technician, customer service engineer and also as a
                    technical support advisor in two different ISP's.
                    As Information and Telecommunications Systems are my background I would like to pursue a role in these
                    areas. My hobbies are hiking, walking, trekking and camping as I love the outdoors.

                <h2>1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2> 
                
                <p>The reason I think that technology is important in a modern day business is that it allows a company to
                    better organise the running of its business. It saves time in key areas and allows the company to keep
                    pace/ahead with its competitors.
                    IT enables for better customer service and gives access for customers to interact with their own portals
                    and accounts which provide up to date information for both parties.
                    Technology provides instant communication such as instant messenger, email or a video links therefore
                    streamlining budgets.
                    Without an IT infrastructure the running of a company would be very slow, outdated, as opposed to a Blue
                    Chip company using modern day technology. A solid framework which provides internal/external solutions
                    would lead to a very happy customer/work colleague experience. All the above would provide a positive
                    profit margin and outcome for the company.
                    br
                    IT ensures for network engineers to implement a secure platform for both business and client in regards
                    to hacking, and also leaves the customer with a safe sense of security when they use a professional
                    company.

                <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
                <p> I found that over the last few days in regards to the project I was involved in was that brainstorming was essential, as it allowed the other teams members to be involved and voice their opinions.
                    A good project plan was established and thought through by all members of the team who were all motivated and who understand the goal and purpose at hand in delivering a successful project.
                    All members all possessed good communication skills and this allowed us to work together, even though there might be some things said that were said which we all didn't agree with it....but were discussed in a professional manner to bring a speedy resolution without any animosity.
                    Trello was also used as our task manager which gave all team members an up to date view of the current status of team member input.

                    <p>To be honest I've never made a website, but I would apply a methodical approach as this a difficult task. 
                        I would have to research on where I would have to start, that would involve me ascertaining information from experienced developers. 
                         will definitely apply what has been previously mentioned in 1.2. I would make sure that I am conversant with the developing tools that I am going to use, and confident within my own ability. 
                         I will make sure that I have a good starting point a middle and an end as I would like it to be successful. I will keep to the deadline as I don’t want to increase the budget for this project. 
                         I would use Trello as my task manager to advise me on where I am within the project.

                    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2> 
                    <p>What could cause a digital project to fail there are many reasons. Firstly, a lack of initial research and planning when adapting to the client’s requirements. The project manager is not aware of the time it is taking to complete the tasks involved in the project, as ideally he/she would need to adhere to a deadline. 
                        The project manager has no overview of process management such as Trello. The team leader has no budget forecast to ensure there are sufficient funds available to fulfil the scheme.
                        There is a lack of communication within the group and the consumer, this can lead to a breakdown of progress and result in a failed project.

                    <p>Firstly, I would meet with the client and make a plan and an assessment of their current infrastructure. 
                        I will make a plan of how the new infrastructure would appear, as in new servers, workstations, and peripherals. 
                        I would also advise on what new software and licenses are required to get this new project off the ground, as in new operating systems and security software for both network engineers and end users. 
                        I would advise the client to use open source software such as Slack & Video Studio Code, as you don’t have to buy the program but if you wish to use any features you can buy theses as and when you need them.

                    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h2>
                    <p>Trello has helped me with the way I organise my tasks, by consulting the board I know which  parts of my project has been completed and what i am currently working on. 
                    I find Trello to be of high value and offers ease in breaking down the planning structure of this and future projects. 
                    I have researched git and Github and I have no experience in the use of this type of software. I am looking forward to working and learning about these programmes. 
                    From what I’ve researched Github is a development platform and offers desktop capability, and is also open source. 
                    It offers features such as project management, security, hosting and team management. 
                    Git is fast, as most of its operations are conducted locally which expels the use of communicating with a remote server.

                    <p>GDPR is the replacement for the 1995 Data Protection Directive. GDPR is to protect individuals right to  access personal data they may have stored about them. 
                        It affects every company that process large amounts of data.  The constraints will be that consent will have to be given by the consumer, and if there are any changes the consumers will have to be notified which is time consuming. 
                        The companies will have to implement tools to allow the consumer to access data and delete if they wish. e.g Facebook. If the consumer withholds data it could  have a major impact on companies that function on the retention of consumer data. 
                        The legal guideline follows a certain criteria such as storage, access, amendment and privacy.
                        These principles should lie at the heart of your approach to processing personal data.

                        <p>The appropriate file types for websites are Jpg, Mpegs, HTML, CSS,TXT, PNG, Mpeg, Wav, Zip. HTML & CSS are the two languages used in the construction of websites. Files can be added into the  HTML editor, such as CSS, jpeg and text files which will appear in the browser. Zip files can be downloaded from a website and be unzipped onto the end users computer. You sometimes find that a.executable file (exe) is downloaded in this manner.

                    <p>I am happy with the tools I have used for organising and planning my website. I find Visual Studio Code as helped me to understand the input which is required to producing a website.Trello as helped to keep on top of things it provides a simple way of organising the planned work. The introduction to CSS and its features has ease the thought of which was sitting at the back of my mind in how I was going to structure the layout of my website.

                            I find the tools that I have used so far to  be appropriate, like I previously said.
                            We have  just been introduced to flexbox layout and code wrap which I find very useful in structuring 
                            my website. As these tools can be used with CSS it will definitely help me with the layout of my website. 
                            Trello as previously mentioned will keep me on track. I am now working with Google Drive which I never used 
                            efore and it has helped me a lot with keeping synchronised with my work from college when I wish to view it

                        <p>The benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems are that a tool or a system has to be tested before 
                            it has been released. During the testing the test engineer will have to make sure that either tool or system meets the requirement of the customer if not this will lead to a drawback and inefficiency and poor production. I think that I will become more efficient when working on a project as I will gather experience as I move along. 
                            If I was a member of a team working on a website project, the work would have to be delegated by the project manager. In regards to communication it  would have to be established and  maintained throughout via software such as Slack and Trello and standup meetings.

                    <p>How I would improve productivity and efficiency, is to make sure that I match tasks to my skills I would ask myself am I upto this task? 
                        Before making any attempt at starting it. Communication is key in the improvement of both fields, the use of instant messaging 
                        applications such as Slack can speed up progress whilst working on a project, and also talking face to face and a quick phone call are 
                        useful methods and should not be ruled out. When working on a project keep goals clear and focussed and know your limitations don't 
                        try and step out of the boundary into the unknown, as this will result in inefficient work and poor productivity.

                        Slack on a regular basis not  only for exchanging messages but for keeping our eyes on the ball as we can upload current work for the

                        I would make sure that  I fully understand the features and  keep the customer’s requirements in mind. I would be using the Test Development Process 
                        as this will result in high quality, simplification of code, optimization of development costs and positive effects on productivity.
