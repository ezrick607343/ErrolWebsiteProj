        <p>The content Iâ€™ve inserted into my homepage are several jpegs and the questions and answers from the assignment. 
            The layout I have chosen is the flex-direction: row; method as I think this will suit my website the best.
             I plan to have more than one webpage as I have a fair amount of material I would  like to include. 
             I also would like to include a navigation bar along with a couple of hyperlinks. 
             I am still currently  working on the website and will hopefully have it finished by the deadline.

            <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
        <p>When designing a website it is your choice to complete the registration for the copyright. 
            All websites and their contents are copyrighted provided they are original.
            The constraints involved are the consideration of the user where they can zoom in and out on the website, the developer has to think about how the end user will appreciate the design and the ease of the use of the website.

        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
            people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. 
            </h2>
            <p>The way of overcoming the access issues that people with disabilities experience is to provide the person with the software that will allow them to interact with the Internet such as using assistive technology. Assistive technology is hardware,software or a product system that will aid in the functional capability for the ease of use of a webpage for a disabled person.

        HTML & CSS are the two languages used in the construction of websites. Files can be added into the  HTML editor, such as CSS, jpeg and text files which will appear in the browser. Zip files can be downloaded from a website and be unzipped onto the end users computer. You sometimes find that a.executable file (exe) is downloaded in this manner.
