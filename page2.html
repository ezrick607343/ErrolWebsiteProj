<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
</h2>
<p>I am happy with the tools I have used for organising and planning my website. I find Visual Studio Code as helped me to understand the input which is required to producing a website.
        Trello as helped to keep on top of things it provides a simple way of organising the planned work. The introduction to CSS and its features has ease the thought of which was sitting at the back of my mind in how I was going to structure the layout of my website.

    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,Trello
    </h2>
    <p>
        I find the tools that I have used so far to  be appropriate, like I previously said.
        We have  just been introduced to flexbox layout and code wrap which I find very useful in structuring 
        my website. As these tools can be used with CSS it will definitely help me with the layout of my website. 
        Trello as previously mentioned will keep me on track. I am now working with Google Drive which I never used 
        efore and it has helped me a lot with keeping synchronised with my work from college when I wish to view it 
        at home.

    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  
    </h2>
    <p>I am happy with what I have planned, as I am not finished with my project I find it difficult to assess the strengths and weaknesses. 
    In regards to  changing anything that is hard to  say I will be able to answer that question once I have finished the project. 
    At the moment I am struggling to hit the deadline, and If I don’t make it. 
    I will have learned from my experience and will plan better for future projects.

<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

<p>The improvements that I could make to my project is to implement what I have learnt. 
    I do feel there is a lot of information that has to be taken in and consumed in a short space of time, but that is the same for everybody. 
    I also know that I will have to organise myself better and will learn from this project and try not to become stressed as this will lead to inefficient work and poor productivity

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
<p>I have reviewed the outcomes and I think they do match the requirements and are also fit for purpose. 
    I have carried out extensive research into the questions that have been asked and also learned a lot from my research. 
    I found the areas that I touched upon to be very interesting knowledgeable.

<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3 Review </h1>
<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? 
    Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
<p>The benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems are that a tool or a system has to be tested before 
        it has been released. During the testing the test engineer will have to make sure that either tool or system meets the requirement of the customer if not this will lead to a drawback and inefficiency and poor production. I think that I will become more efficient when working on a project as I will gather experience as I move along. 
        If I was a member of a team working on a website project, the work would have to be delegated by the project manager. In regards to communication it  would have to be established and  maintained throughout via software such as Slack and Trello and standup meetings.

    <div  class= "flextext">
<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>How I would improve productivity and efficiency, is to make sure that I match tasks to my skills I would ask myself am I upto this task? 
    Before making any attempt at starting it. Communication is key in the improvement of both fields, the use of instant messaging 
    applications such as Slack can speed up progress whilst working on a project, and also talking face to face and a quick phone call are 
    useful methods and should not be ruled out. When working on a project keep goals clear and focussed and know your limitations don't 
    try and step out of the boundary into the unknown, as this will result in inefficient work and poor productivity.

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</h2>
<p>In the future I will not put myself under pressure this will lead to poor productivity. 
    I will plan  my approach in a more methodical manner. 
    What I would do differently when working in a team is that I will ask my team members that we need to communicate regularly and to use 
    Slack on a regular basis not  only for exchanging messages but for keeping our eyes on the ball as we can upload current work for the 
    team to view and pass their opinion.

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

<p>I would write an effective test case, I would start by identifying the scope and purpose of testing before starting the test process. 
    I would make sure that  I fully understand the features and  keep the customer’s requirements in mind. I would be using the Test Development Process 
    as this will result in high quality, simplification of code, optimization of development costs and positive effects on productivity.
